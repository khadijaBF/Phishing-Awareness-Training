## Introduction
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity.

## What is Phishing?
Phishing attacks often come in the form of emails, phone calls, or messages that appear legitimate but are actually fraudulent. The aim is to steal personal information or install malware on the victim's system.

## Common Phishing Techniques
- **Email Phishing**: Attackers send fraudulent emails that look like they are from legitimate sources, asking for sensitive information.
- **Spear Phishing**: A more targeted form of phishing, where the attacker customizes the attack to a specific individual or organization.
- **Whaling**: A phishing attack aimed at high-profile targets like executives or senior management.
- **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**: Phishing attempts via phone calls, where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations.
- **Smishing**: Phishing attempts conducted via SMS text messages.

## How to Spot Phishing Attempts
- **Look for spelling and grammar mistakes** in emails or messages.
- **Check the sender’s email address** for subtle differences from a legitimate address.
- **Be cautious of urgent requests**, such as threats to suspend an account.
- **Don’t click on suspicious links**; hover over them to see where they lead.
- **Verify through other channels** if in doubt (e.g., calling the company directly).

## Preventative Measures
- **Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for added security.
- **Regularly update your passwords** and use a password manager.
- **Be cautious with personal information**; don’t share sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.
- **Educate others** about phishing to reduce the risk of successful attacks.

## Conclusion
Phishing attacks are a growing threat, but with awareness and caution, they can be avoided. This document aims to help you understand the risks and how to defend yourself against phishing attempts.
